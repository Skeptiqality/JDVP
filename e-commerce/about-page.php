                                Family Supermarket was founded in 1897 as a small neighborhood grocery dedicated to serving local families with fresh, quality products.
                                What began as a modest market grew steadily through the years, guided by strong family values, trust, and close ties to the community.
                                For generations, the store adapted to changing customer needs while staying true to its original mission of providing reliable and
                                affordable daily essentials.
